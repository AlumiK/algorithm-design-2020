# Find Majority Numbers

## Description

You are given an array of `n` integers, and you are going to find all the elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.

## Input

The first line of the input is an integer `n`, which is the number of lines below. Each of the next `n` lines contains a single non-negative integer.

## Output

Each line of the output contains an integer that appears more than ⌊n/3⌋ times, and the output integers are in an ascending order.

## Hint

The algorithm should take O(n) in time and O(1) in space.

## Example

### Input

```text
8
1
1
1
2
2
3
3
3
```

### Output

```text
