# Cashier's Algorithm

## Description

Given currency denominations {1, 5, 10, 20, 50}, devise a method to pay amount to customer using fewest coins.

## Input

An integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 99), which is the amount of money that should be paid to customer.

## Output

For each type of coins, output their `value*count`, and add them up. For example, if the amount of money is 25, the input will be 25, and the output should be `20*1+5*1`.

## Example

### Input 1

```text
25
```

### Output 1

```text
20*1+5*1
```

### Input 2

```text
32
```

### Output 2

```text
20*1+10*1+1*2
```
